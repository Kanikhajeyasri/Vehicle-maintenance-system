This code implements a simple Vehicle Maintenance System using Java Swing, a GUI framework. It maintains a list of vehicles with their names, maintenance dates, and descriptions, using an ArrayList for storing the data and a JList to display it. The GUI is divided into three sections: a top panel for entering vehicle details (name, date, description), a center panel displaying the list of vehicles, and a bottom panel with a button to remove selected entries. When a user enters vehicle details and clicks the "Add Vehicle" button, the system validates the input, adds a new Vehicle object to the list, and updates the display. The "Remove Selected" button allows users to delete a selected vehicle from the list. Error handling ensures all fields are completed when adding a vehicle and that a selection is made when removing. The application is launched in the main method using the Swing event dispatch thread.
